How do informational frictions affect the shape of the responses to various shocks? The second part will cover models of investment with credit constraints. We will ask questions such as: What is the transmission mechanism from shocks to the financial sector to the real economy? What determines optimal decisions about capitalization at the individual and at the social level? The third part will cover search models of decentralized trade applied both to labor markets and to financial markets. In particular, the models will have informational imperfections.",,,"14.461-Fall2009","14.461||IMSCP-MD5-d6d0bcfa05015ce49d3fe746aa09473b",,"http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/79634",,,"en-US",,,,,,,,"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported","This site (c) Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2013.

After grounding our conversation in accounts of natural history and medicine that predate the rise of biology as a discipline, we explore modes of theorizing historical and contemporary bioscience. Drawing on the work of historian William Coleman, we examine the forms, functions, and transformations of biological and medical objects of study. Along the way we treat the history of heredity, molecular biology, race, medicine in the colonies and the metropole, and bioeconomic exchange. We read anthropological literature on old and new forms of biopower, at scales from the molecular to the organismic to the global. The course includes readings from the HASTS Common Exam List.

The main qualification for taking part in the Workshop is an interest in, and an urgent desire to do something about, specifying the type, quality, image and performance of the new wave of speculative office buildings that will be needed in the next cycle of economic recovery. The questions the workshop will address are: What has and has not changed over the last three decades in the context of office development in the US? What are the causes of the apparent current lack of interest in product development and renewal in the office market in the US? What likely changes, e.g. in tenant and user demand, in business culture, in locational choice, in financial and funding practice, in leasing arrangements, in technology, in constructional technique, could justify and stimulate innovation? What commercial incentives would it take for developers to take advantage of such changes? What innovations in new building features, products and services for office development would be likely to result, especially if emerging user demand were to be taken seriously by suppliers?",,,"4.181-Spring2003","4.181||IMSCP-MD5-4de6c3396eb3cc1e78a10789ce4a1278",,"http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/55812",,,"en-US",,,,,,,,,,"This site (c) Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003.

It is a writing-intensive class based on the premise that writing and editing are forms of critical thinking. The syllabus outlines the structure of the course and the readings and assignments for each week. The discipline of art history periodically surges into ""crisis."" The demise of formalism as a guiding tenet, or connoisseurial appreciation as a general guide, plunged the field into confusion during the 1970s when the battle raged over ""social histories of art"" or ""revisionism;"" in the late 1990s the debate was staged between ""visual studies"" versus ""normative art history."" The course takes this confusion as itself worthy of study, and seeks to make available some of the new methodologies that have emerged over the past two decades. The ultimate goal is to bring students closer to discovering their own individual methods and voices as writers of art historical prose. In broader terms, we will attempt to understand the historiography of visual art and images more broadly. Our efforts will be predicated on the conviction that art history can serve as a generative discipline for all humanistic disciplines, and even those that style themselves as ""Bildwissenschaft"" (or ""image-science"").",,,"4.661-Fall2002","4.661||IMSCP-MD5-8ecd8de27d08c4a4618020d435a08969",,"http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/101678",,,"en-US",,,,,,,,"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported","This site (c) Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2016.

To cope with this permanent exposure to DNA-damaging agents, such as the sun's radiation or by-products of our normal metabolism, powerful DNA damage checkpoints have evolved that allow organisms to survive this constant assault on their genomes. In this class we will analyze classical and recent papers from the primary research literature to gain a profound understanding of checkpoints that act as powerful emergency brakes to prevent cancer. We will consider basic principles of cell proliferation and molecular details of the DNA damage response. We will discuss the methods and model organisms typically used in this field as well as how an understanding of checkpoint mechanisms translates into the development of treatments for human cancer. This course will not stop at discussing literature. We will take it one step further and analyze real data in an MIT Biology laboratory. This course is one of many Advanced Undergraduate Seminars offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about current biological research in a highly interactive setting.

Language is structured at many levels: sounds are structured into morphemes; morphemes are structured into words; words are structured into sentences; and sentences are structured into discourses. In this course, we will concentrate mostly on information processing above the word level. We will also discuss sound and word-level information processing, but to a lesser extent. Topics to be covered include: syntax; sentence comprehension; semantic, pragmatic and discourse comprehension; intonation; neural networks and language processing; neural imaging and language processing; language production; language acquisition; speech; speech comprehension; visual word recognition; and the relationship between language and thought.","16135 bytes||14404 bytes||31409 bytes||20377 bytes||11563 bytes||11 bytes||4586 bytes||21366 bytes||11602 bytes||38351 bytes||4755 bytes||27322 bytes||25313 bytes||4039 bytes||301 bytes||354 bytes||339 bytes||180 bytes||285 bytes||67 bytes||17685 bytes||49 bytes||143 bytes||247 bytes||19283 bytes||262 bytes||20579 bytes||89242 bytes||139660 bytes||108546 bytes||19283 bytes||3486 bytes||811 bytes||813 bytes||830 bytes||515 bytes||2097 bytes||14025 bytes||9926 bytes||9927 bytes||9383 bytes||9443 bytes||9422 bytes||10409 bytes||9618 bytes||9438 bytes||9927 bytes","text/html||text/html||text/html||text/html||text/html||text/plain||text/html||text/html||text/html||text/html||text/html||text/css||text/css||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||image/jpeg||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||image/jpeg||image/gif||image/jpeg||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||image/jpeg||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||text/html||text/plain||application/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml","9.59J-Fall2002","9.59J||24.905J||IMSCP-MD5-1982452d5480b73dee6cfc97fd4d9db9",,"http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/35791",,,"en-US",,,,,,,,,,"This site (c) Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003.

From the course home page: Highlights of this Course We are now at an unprecedented period in the field of neuroscience: We can watch the human brain in action as it sees, thinks, decides, reads, and remembers. Using the recently-developed technique of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), local neural activity can be monitored in the normal human brain in a noninvasive fashion and with good spatial resolution. A large number of far-reaching and fundamental questions about the human brain can now be answered using straightforward applications of this new technology. This is particularly true in the area of high-level vision, the study of how we interpret and use visual information (including object recognition, visual attention, perceptual awareness, visually guided action, visual memory, and other topics). The goals of this course are to help students to become savvy and critical readers of the current neuroimaging literature, to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the technique, and to design their own cutting-edge, theoretically motivated studies. Students will read, present to the class, and critique current neuroimaging articles, as well as write detailed proposals for experiments of their own. Lectures will cover theoretical background on some of the major areas in high-level vision, including visual recognition and attention, as well as an overview of what fMRI has taught us and can in future teach us about each of these topics. Lectures and discussions will also cover fMRI methods and experimental design. A prior course in statistics and at least one course in perception or cognition are required.",,,"9.71-Fall2002","9.71||IMSCP-MD5-39caf429fc746274e66ac39b9328d00f",,"http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/36328",,,"en-US",,,,,,,,,,"This site (c) Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003.

This course surveys the literature on human memory and learning, including consideration of the cognitive and neural organization of memory, the basis of remembering and forgetting, and the nature of false memories. Cognitive theory and behavioral evidence will be integrated with data from neuropsychology and functional brain imaging. Course Description Surveys literature on human memory and learning. Focuses on the organization of memory at cognitive and neural levels, the basis of remembering and forgetting, and false memories.

Topics: numerical linear algebra, solution of nonlinear algebraic equations and ordinary differential equations, solution of partial differential equations (e.g. Navier-Stokes), numerical methods in molecular simulation (dynamics, geometry optimization). All methods are presented within the context of chemical engineering problems. Familiarity with structured programming is assumed. From the course home page: Course Description This course focuses on the use of modern computational and mathematical techniques in chemical engineering. Starting from a discussion of linear systems as the basic computational unit in scientific computing, methods for solving sets of nonlinear algebraic equations, ordinary differential equations, and differential-algebraic (DAE) systems are presented. Probability theory and its use in physical modeling is covered, as is the statistical analysis of data and parameter estimation. The finite difference and finite element techniques are presented for converting the partial differential equations obtained from transport phenomena to DAE systems. The use of these techniques will be demonstrated throughout the course in the MATLAB® computing environment.","15839 bytes||13042 bytes||19984 bytes||29009 bytes||14174 bytes||14358 bytes||16962

Indeed, obtaining good performance requires a comprehensive understanding of all layers of the underlying platform, deep insight into the computation at hand, and the ingenuity and creativity required to obtain an effective mapping of the computation onto the machine. The reward for mastering these sophisticated and challenging topics is the ability to make computations that can process large amount of data orders of magnitude more quickly and efficiently and to obtain results that are unavailable with standard practice. This course is a hands-on, project-based introduction to building scalable and high-performance software systems.

To stay competitive companies have sought to shorten the construction times of new infrastructure by managing construction development efforts effectively by using different project management tools. In this course, three important aspects of construction project management are taught: (1) the theory, methods and quantitative tools used to effectively plan, organize, and control construction projects; (2) efficient management methods revealed through practice and research; (3) hands-on, practical project management knowledge from on-site situations. To achieve this, we will use a basic project management framework in which the project life-cycle is broken into organizing, planning, monitoring, controlling and learning from old and current construction projects. Within the framework, you will learn the methodologies and tools necessary for each aspect of the process as well as the theories upon which these are built.

Assignments include formal essays and online projects. From the Course Home Page: Course Description There has been much discussion in recent years, on this campus and elsewhere, about the death of the book. Digitization and various forms of electronic media, some critics say, are rendering the printed text as obsolete as the writing quill. In this subject we will examine the claims for and against the demise of the book, but we also supplement these arguments with an historical perspective they lack: we examine books and printing technology during the Early Modern period of European history, from roughly 1450 to 1800. We will begin with the theoretical and historical overviews of Walter Ong and Elizabeth Eisenstein, after which we will study specific cases such as the writings and readers of Erasmus and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, English chapbooks, and stage plays in print. Finally, we will reconsider the issues raised by digital technologies today in light of these historical perspectives. This subject is jointly listed as 21H.418 and CMS.880. It satisfies requirements towards the Major and the Minor in History and in Comparative Media Studies, and is also open to graduate students in the Comparative Media Studies Program and in other MIT and Harvard graduate programs.","15858 bytes||13827 bytes||35034 bytes||30352 bytes||11813 bytes||13821 bytes||12292 bytes||20939 bytes||16622 bytes||115 bytes||4586 bytes||18637 bytes||11602 bytes||18220 bytes||4755 bytes||27322 bytes||25313 bytes||4039 bytes||301 bytes||354 bytes||339 bytes||180 bytes||285 bytes||67 bytes||17685 bytes||49 bytes||143 bytes||247 bytes||19283 bytes||262 bytes||33191 bytes||65284 bytes||71649 bytes||64630 bytes||73854 bytes||68001 bytes||86467 bytes||75415 bytes||83277 bytes||79270 bytes||81996 bytes||123003 bytes||85900 bytes||63748 bytes||66603 bytes||77828 bytes||92407 bytes||61553 bytes||87641 bytes||73859 bytes||58506 bytes||94593 bytes||124844 bytes||19283 bytes||3486 bytes||811 bytes||813 bytes||830 bytes||505 bytes||2097 bytes||39160 bytes||8681 bytes||9277 bytes||9229 bytes||8719 bytes||9282 bytes||9274 bytes||9226 bytes||8686 bytes||9268 bytes||9286 bytes||9235 bytes||9272 bytes||8729 bytes||9232 bytes||8695 bytes||9220 bytes||8706 bytes||8803 bytes||9245 bytes||10536 bytes||9281 bytes||9280 bytes||9298 bytes||9282 bytes||9233 bytes||9244 bytes||8689 bytes||9264 bytes||9284 bytes||9249 bytes||9272 bytes","text/html||text/html||text/html||text/html||text/html||text/html||text/html||text/html||text/html||text/plain||text/html||text/html||text/html||text/html||text/html||text/css||text/css||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||image/jpeg||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||image/jpeg||image/gif||image/jpeg||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||image/jpeg||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||text/html||text/plain||application/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml","21H.418-Fall2002","21H.418||CMS.880||IMSCP-MD5-9c54eb26ceaf9f497b913448065c68c3",,"http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/34937",,,"en-US",,,,,,,,,,"This site (c) Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003.

It involves the analysis of conflict, cooperation, and (tacit) communication. Game theory has applications in several fields, such as economics, politics, law, biology, and computer science. In this course, I will introduce the basic tools of game theoretic analysis. In the process, I will outline some of the many applications of game theory, primarily in economics and political science. Game Theory has emerged as a branch of mathematics and is still quite mathematical. Our emphasis will be on the conceptual analysis, keeping the level of math to a minimum, especially at a level that should be quite acceptable to the average MIT student. Yet bear in mind that this still implies that you should be at ease with basic probability theory and calculus, and more importantly, you should be used to thinking in mathematical terms. Intermediate Microeconomics is also a prerequisite (simultaneous attendance to one of the intermediate courses is also acceptable).

And, what impedes trade and why do some countries deliberately erect policy impediments to trade? The course also concerns normative issues, such as: Is trade openness beneficial to a representative agent? And, Are there winners and losers from trade and if so, can we identify them? Throughout, these issues are approached in neoclassical settings as well as those with market failures, at the industry-level as well as the firm-level, and in the presence of both mobile and immobile factors (e.g., foreign direct investment (FDI), offshoring of tasks, multinational firms and immigration).",,,"14.581-Spring2011","14.581||IMSCP-MD5-7bdf61ac8f8440511e7eb5e2fa6065e2",,"http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/84479",,,"en-US",,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/73643",,"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported","This site (c) Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2014.

Description from the course home page: This course is the second of a two-term sequence with 6.450. The focus is on coding techniques for approaching the Shannon limit of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels, their performance analysis, and design principles. After a review of 6.450 and the Shannon limit for AWGN channels, the course begins by discussing small signal constellations, performance analysis and coding gain, and hard-decision and soft-decision decoding. It continues with binary linear block codes, Reed-Muller codes, finite fields, Reed-Solomon and BCH codes, binary linear convolutional codes, and the Viterbi algorithm. More advanced topics include trellis representations of binary linear block codes and trellis-based decoding; codes on graphs; the sum-product and min-sum algorithms; the BCJR algorithm; turbo codes, LDPC codes and RA codes; and performance of LDPC codes with iterative decoding. Finally, the course addresses coding for the bandwidth-limited regime, including lattice codes, trellis-coded modulation, multilevel coding and shaping.

Subject examines a range of communication styles and techniques resulting from different cultural norms and traditions. It begins with a general theoretical framework and then moves into case studies. Topics include understanding the relationship between communication and culture, differences in verbal and non-verbal communication styles, barriers to intercultural communication, modes of specific cross-cultural communication activities (e.g. argumentation, negotiation, conflict resolution) and intercultural adjustment. Case studies explore specific ways of communicating in Asian and European cultures. Graduate students are expected to complete additional assignments. Taught in English. From the course home page: Course Description It has become commonplace knowledge that globalization is one of the major forces shaping our world. If we look at the spread of information, ideas, capital, media, cultural artifacts--or for that matter, people--we can see the boundaries and borders that have historically separated one country or one group from another are becoming more and more permeable. For proof of this close to home, you need only to look at the composition of the MIT student body: 8 percent of the undergraduates and 37 percent of the graduate students are from 109 different countries. ""Communicating Across Cultures"" is designed to help you meet the challenges of living in a world in which, increasingly, you will be asked to interact with people who may not be like you in fundamental ways. Its primary goals are to help you become more sensitive to intercultural communication differences, and to provide you with the knowledge and skills that will help you interact successfully with people from cultures other than your own. We hope the course will accomplish those goals by exposing you to some of the best writers and scholars on the subject of intercultural communication, and by giving you a variety of opportunities to practice intercultural communication yourself. As you read the syllabus for this course, we hope you get a sense of our commitment to making this course a rewarding experience for you.",,,"21F.019-Spring2003","21F.019||21F.021||IMSCP-MD5-4149e383430eea9f222b0707f23b1317",,"http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/36356",,,"en-US",,,,,,,,,,"This site (c) Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003.

Basic reading and writing are also taught. Work in the language laboratory is coordinated with, and supplemented to, class work. For graduate credit, see 21F.151. Description from course home page: This subject is the first semester of two that form an introduction to modern standard Chinese, commonly called Mandarin. Though not everyone taking this course will be an absolute beginner, the course presupposes no prior background in the language. The emphasis is on developing (a) basic conversational abilities (pronunciation, fundamental grammatical patterns, common vocabulary, and standard usage), (b) basic reading and writing skills, and (c) an understanding of the language learning process so that students are able to continue studying effectively on their own. The main text is J. K. Wheatley’s Learning Chinese: A Foundation Course in Mandarin, part I (unpublished, but available online), which consists of several introductory chapters, seven core lessons (labeled 1, 2, 3…) and six character lessons (labeled A, B, C…). (Part II of the book forms the basis of 21F.102, which will also be published on OpenCourseWare.) The core lessons of Learning Chinese present the language discursively, in English, topic by topic with example sentences, dialogues, conversations and narratives in romanization, interspersed with short exercises by which students can monitor their progress. These lessons serve the rapid accumulation of vocabulary, grammatical patterns and usage, primarily for conversation, but also for reading and composition. The character lessons relate to, but are not identical to the core lessons. They serve to introduce the written language (both the traditional character set and the simplified) at a manageable rate and in appropriate contexts. The two sets of lessons will be interleafed, with lesson 1 followed by A, lesson 2 by B, etc. Assistance in internalizing lesson material is provided by way of a computer program called flashCube, developed by Jordan Gilliland while a graduate student at MIT. FlashCube will not be available at the opening of the 21F.101 OCW site but will be added, along with supporting programs and documentation, in the near future. As the name suggests, flashCube delivers through the medium of the computer what has traditionally been provided by the folk-method of the flashcard, the vocabulary or phrase notebook, and the tape recorder. FlashCube stores, in a compact and convenient format, much of the Chinese material presented in Learning Chinese, and allows students to test themselves into and out of the spoken or written language.",,,"21F.101-Fall2004","21F.101||IMSCP-MD5-3e084bffb4b4fa621dd535a6cf5ffd06",,"http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/36828",,,"en-US",,,,,,,,,,"This site (c) Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003.

Basic reading and writing are also taught. Work in the language laboratory is coordinated with, and supplemented to, class work. For graduate credit, see 21F.151. Description from course home page: This subject is the first semester of two that form an introduction to modern standard Chinese, commonly called Mandarin. Though not everyone taking this course will be an absolute beginner, the course presupposes no prior background in the language. The emphasis is on developing (a) basic conversational abilities (pronunciation, fundamental grammatical patterns, common vocabulary, and standard usage), (b) basic reading and writing skills, and (c) an understanding of the language learning process so that students are able to continue studying effectively on their own. The main text is J. K. Wheatley’s Learning Chinese: A Foundation Course in Mandarin, part I (unpublished, but available online), which consists of several introductory chapters, seven core lessons (labeled 1, 2, 3…) and six character lessons (labeled A, B, C…). (Part II of the book forms the basis of 21F.102, which will also be published on OpenCourseWare.) The core lessons of Learning Chinese present the language discursively, in English, topic by topic with example sentences, dialogues, conversations and narratives in romanization, interspersed with short exercises by which students can monitor their progress. These lessons serve the rapid accumulation of vocabulary, grammatical patterns and usage, primarily for conversation, but also for reading and composition. The character lessons relate to, but are not identical to the core lessons. They serve to introduce the written language (both the traditional character set and the simplified) at a manageable rate and in appropriate contexts. The two sets of lessons will be interleafed, with lesson 1 followed by A, lesson 2 by B, etc. Assistance in internalizing lesson material is provided by way of a computer program called flashCube, developed by Jordan Gilliland while a graduate student at MIT. FlashCube will not be available at the opening of the 21F.101 OCW site but will be added, along with supporting programs and documentation, in the near future. As the name suggests, flashCube delivers through the medium of the computer what has traditionally been provided by the folk-method of the flashcard, the vocabulary or phrase notebook, and the tape recorder. FlashCube stores, in a compact and convenient format, much of the Chinese material presented in Learning Chinese, and allows students to test themselves into and out of the spoken or written language.",,,"21F.101-Spring2005","21F.101||21F.151||IMSCP-MD5-00d7daefdc04f41b75c9a698705fc89b",,"http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/36894",,,"en-US",,,,,,,,,,"This site (c) Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003.

Though not everyone taking this course will be an absolute beginner, the course presupposes only 21G.101/151, the beginning course in the sequence. The purpose of this course is to develop: (a) basic conversational abilities (pronunciation, fundamental grammatical patterns, common vocabulary, and standard usage); (b) basic reading skills (in both the traditional character set and the simplified); (c) an understanding of the way the Chinese writing system is structured, and the ability to copy and write characters; and (d) a sense of what learning a language like Chinese entails, and the sort of learning processes that it involves, so students are able to continue studying effectively on their own. The main text is J. K. Wheatley's Learning Chinese: A Foundation Course in Mandarin, part II (unpublished, but available online). (Part I of the book forms the basis of 21G.101/151, which is also published on OpenCourseWare.) Chinese Sequence on OCW OpenCourseWare now offers a complete sequence of four Chinese language courses, covering beginning to intermediate levels of instruction at MIT. They can be used not just as the basis for taught courses, but also for self-instruction and elementary-to-intermediate review. The four Chinese subjects provide the following materials: an online textbook in four parts, J. K. Wheatley's Learning Chinese: A Foundation Course in Mandarin; audio files of the main conversational and narrative material in this book; and syllabi and day-by-day schedules for each term. &nbsp; Course sequnce on OCW.

(Steven Elliot)||Bergeron, Bryan P.||Sands, Daniel Z.||Blander, Jeffrey",,,"Spring 2003",,"2003-06",,"The healthcare system in the US has been in the midst of a rapid transition in response to changing trends and patterns of care. The growing emphasis on evidence-based medical practice, continuous quality improvement, clinical and cost-effectiveness, and risk management have led to a sea change in medical practice that has been stressful for clinicians, patients, and administrators. As care becomes more tightly managed, it becomes a challenge for clinicians, administrators, and patients to balance time, money, resources, and clinical outcomes. Can emerging technologies help solve these complex problems? How has the demise of the dot.com industry effected these trends and slowed the proliferation of potential solutions? This innovative, trans-faculty course will teach the student how information technologies are shaping and redefining the health care marketplace through examining aspects related to 1) improved economies of scale, 2) greater technical and business efficiencies in the delivery of care to patients, 3) advanced tools for patient education and self-care, 4) network integrated decision support tools for clinicians, and 5) e-health applications and e-commerce. Students are required to take this course in conjunction with HST 923, the tutorial/practicum portion of the course, where they will work in interdisciplinary teams (including students in medicine, business, law, engineering, computer science, media, public health, and government) to analyze, develop, and present an innovative solution to a current or future clinical management program or health care problem which will incorporate (but is not limited to) management techniques, services, and technologies as presented during lectures and laboratories. Students' proposed solutions will draw upon their understanding of tools and principles acquired during the course and will be presented as an application design on the final day of the course. Opportunities to interact with corporate sponsors will enhance the emphasis on practical solutions to real world problems.Sponsored driven projects in past years have included those from Pfizer Health Solutions, Merck, Johnson and Johnson, Mass General, and Warner Lambert. (Note: A special project will be organized and supported by the faculty this year to help students identify ways to support efforts to combat bio-terrorism through improved uses of clinical and bioinformatic systems.)",,,"HST.921-Spring2003","HST.921||HST.923||IMSCP-MD5-cbc039471630a05007aaf54eb7c3ba18",,"http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/41934",,,"en-US",,,,,,,,,,"This site (c) Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003.

Particular attention given to the interplay of politics, culture, and social questions in the period, as well as the impact of the Revolution outside France. From the course home page: Course Description The French esteem the Revolution of 1789 to be the turning point in their national history; journalists, politicians, scholars, and others outside France have called this moment the birth of modern political culture. In this subject we will begin with a brief survey of French politics, culture and society in the century prior to the Revolution, emphasizing the reasons for the end of the Old Regime and the origins of the Revolution. Next, we will examine the turbulent decade of the 1790s, when the French experimented with a constitutional monarchy, a republic, a dictatorship by committee, and a parliamentary form of government, only to end in a military coup d'état staged by Napoléon Bonaparte and his supporters. In 1804, Napoléon crowned himself emperor thus initiating the First Empire, which was characterized by relentless military campaigning abroad and the consolidation of certain legal and administrative reforms at home. Finally, we will consider the impact of the Revolution and its Napoleonic sequel in Europe and elsewhere, and we will discuss the ongoing influence of these events in the following two centuries. This subject is open to all interested undergraduates and graduate students; there are no prerequisites.","16090 bytes||13667 bytes||68026 bytes||14652 bytes||11548 bytes||13897 bytes||12238 bytes||11 bytes||4586 bytes||18637 bytes||11602 bytes||18220 bytes||4755 bytes||27322 bytes||25313 bytes||4039 bytes||301 bytes||354 bytes||339 bytes||180 bytes||285 bytes||67 bytes||17685 bytes||49 bytes||143 bytes||247 bytes||19283 bytes||262 bytes||27994 bytes||64258 bytes||113610 bytes||95974 bytes||19283 bytes||3486 bytes||811 bytes||813 bytes||830 bytes||537 bytes||2097 bytes||16850 bytes||8903 bytes||8363 bytes||9655 bytes||8207 bytes||8320 bytes||8352 bytes||8355 bytes||8361 bytes||8347 bytes||8883 bytes||8881 bytes","text/html||text/html||text/html||text/html||text/html||text/html||text/html||text/plain||text/html||text/html||text/html||text/html||text/html||text/css||text/css||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||image/jpeg||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||image/jpeg||image/gif||image/jpeg||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||image/jpeg||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||text/html||text/plain||application/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml","21H.346-Spring2000","21H.346||IMSCP-MD5-0d80f1381599d3bfa8af2f2947bae3c6",,"http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/34936",,,"en-US",,,,,,,,,,"This site (c) Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003.

Freedom of expression? Sexual liberty? Economic liberty? Political liberty? • What sorts of equality should a just society ensure? Equality of opportunity? Of economic outcome? Political equality? • Can a society ensure both liberty and equality? Or are these warring political values? We will approach these questions by examining answers to them provided by three contemporary theories of justice: utilitarianism, libertarianism, and egalitarian liberalism. To clarify these theories, and assess their strengths and weaknesses, we will discuss their implications for some issues about liberty and equality that are topics of current controversy and that exemplify the three broad questions about liberty and equality noted above.","14529 bytes||15741 bytes||58669 bytes||34343 bytes||21140 bytes||14175 bytes||16232 bytes||11 bytes||4586 bytes||18637

Or does the mind stand to the brain as a computer program stands to the hardware? How can creatures like ourselves think thoughts that are ""about"" things? (For example, we can all think that Aristotle is a philosopher, and in that sense think ""about"" Aristotle, but what is the explanation of this quite remarkable ability?)

Beginning with a consideration of key terms (sex, gender, oppression) and the meaning of social construction, we will move on to study three central feminist approaches to political thought (humanist, gynocentric, and dominance). The primary goal of this course is to familiarize students with key issues, questions and debates in feminist theory, both historical and contemporary. This semester you will become acquainted with many of the critical questions and concepts feminist scholars have developed as tools for thinking about gendered experience. In addition to the presentation of theoretical ideas, we will consider examples of practical political application of those concepts. The concluding weeks of the course address the many tensions between generalized theoretical approaches and localized political efforts, particularly as they relate to identity politics and issues of diversity within feminist groups and movements. Finally, we will consider the connections, commonalities, and differences between feminist political thought and other theoretical approaches to political movements, such as queer theory, postcolonial theory, and global and human rights organizing.",,,"17.007J-Spring2006","17.007J||17.006||24.237||SP.601J||WGS.601J||IMSCP-MD5-204d18245e789b8d25713096ee0338e9",,"http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/45584",,,"en-US",,,,,,,,,,"This site (c) Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003.

Because we want to focus, we need to make difficult choices as to which topics to cover. We tend to rotate topics from year to year to keep the course fresh. Eventually, we hope to have a text book that would allow you to work through some additional topics not covered in a particular instantiation of the course. Until then, our apologies.

Moreover, all of these plays are historical: some draw their subject matter from past centuries, while others convey a sense of how contemporary events are informed by and located within a larger historical frame. During the first century of film, television, and computers, it seems that writers for the theater have been especially attuned to the relationships between past and present, in their art and in society. Within this multimedia context, we will consider what drama in particular has to offer now and in the future.

Sometimes it doesn't laugh at all, but some resolution seems affirmative or structurally functional, in some satisfying way (by what categoriy is Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet a ""comedy""? how can Dante call his vision of an organized universe a ""Comedy""?). We read jokes, literary texts, tales, satirical paintings, and films, and we address a few theories about how comedy works (does it affirm? does it critique? does it disrupt? does it tip the categories upside-down? does it release energy? does it cause trouble? how is it ithat so many different effects and emotions are called ""comic""?).

From the course home page: Course Description This subject traces the history of the European novel by studying texts that have been influential in that history in connection with two interrelated ideas. The first of these ideas underlies much of our modern regard for the novel as a literary form–namely, the idea that if fiction intends to deal with the most important forces animating the collective life of humanity, it will not deal with the actions of persons of immense consequence–kings, princes, high elected officials and the like–but rather with the lives of apparently ordinary people and the everyday details of their social ambitions and desires: to use a phrase of Balzac's, with ""ce qui se passe partout"" (what happens everywhere). This idea sometimes goes with another: that the most significant representations of the human condition are those dealing with a particular type of protagonist–namely, with someone not obviously qualified to be of consequence in the world (by reason, say, of birth or inheritance) but nonetheless conceives of himself or herself as destined for great accomplishment and who tries to compel society to accept him or her as its agent.",,,"21L.472-Fall2001","21L.472||IMSCP-MD5-d7cea407b6a581a70836bbed44e25308",,"http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/49514",,,"en-US",,,,,,,,,,"This site (c) Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003.

Examples include microelectronic circuitry, magnetic memory and drug delivery applications.",,,"3.40J-Spring2004","3.40J||22.71J||IMSCP-MD5-60ea78d6d65695a69af4ea63730d9878",,"http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/61400",,,"en-US",,,,"http://www.core.org.cn/OcwWeb/Materials-Science-and-Engineering/3-40JPhysical-MetallurgySpring2003/CourseHome/index.htm",,,,,,"This site (c) Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2010.

The prerequisites for this course are the undergraduate courses in thermodynamics and fluid mechanics, specifically Thermal Fluids Engineering I and Thermal Fluids Engineering II or their equivalents. This course covers problems of heat and mass transfer in greater depth and complexity than is done in those courses and incorporates many subjects that are not included or are treated lightly in those courses; analysis is given greater emphasis than the use of correlations.

First, a general process model for control is developed to understand the limitations a specific process places on the type of control used. A general model for process variation is presented and three methods are developed to minimize variations: Statistical Process Control, Process Optimization and in-process Feedback Control. These are considered in a hierarchy of cost-performance tradeoffs, where performance is based on changes in process capability.

How does democracy affect economic development and political conflict? Why do some countries centralize power while others threaten to fall apart through secession and civil war?

Military doctrine makes assumptions about the nature of future battlefields, and determines what the division of labor on those battlefields will be between different military tools. Doctrine also therefore determines the organizational hierarchy among the various branches of the military which wield those tools. Thus, one way to think of the relationship between military technology and doctrine is to think of doctrine as a filter that a military organization will use to assess the effect that future technologies or new battlefields are likely to have on its existing organizational hierarchy.",,,,,"17.950||IMSCP-MD5-1310a1f14f3f83c3cb22c512f2b69f75",,"http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/65387","17.950-Spring2005",,"en-US",,,,,,,,,"This site (c) Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2011.

In addition we will consider different ways of looking at power and political culture in modern societies, issues of race and class, poverty and welfare, sexuality and morality.",,,"17.118J-Fall2000","17.118J||SP.412J||WGS.412J||IMSCP-MD5-d349219e7b74f505eedfb2ef6ce29bb8",,"http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/77168",,,"en-US",,,,"http://mit.universia.com.br/curso.jsp?codcurso=72||http://mit.ocw.universia.net/17.118J/OcwWeb/Political-Science/17-118JFall2000/CourseHome/index.htm||http://www.myoops.org/twocw/mit/Political-Science/17-118JFall2000/CourseHome/index.htm",,,,,,"This site (c) Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2013.

How does democracy affect economic development and political conflict? Why do some countries centralize power while others threaten to fall apart through secession and civil war? We will use examples from a wide range of countries including Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Iraq, Italy, Mexico, and the United States.

Several field trips planned to visit local industrial landscapes. Assignments involve weekly short, written responses to the readings, and discussion-leading. Final project is a photo-essay on the student's choice of industrial site (photographic experience not necessary). Description from course home page: What makes a landscape industrial? What makes an industrial site a landscape? This class considers how the development of technology in America intersected with the natural world, in some cases reshaping its contours and meanings, and in other cases getting redefined by nature's largesse or diminished capacity. The dynamic relationship between these two forces offers many examples of ""historical camouflage"" in which places and things are not entirely what they seem to be. At this point in history, what things that we see are not industrial in some way? How can we learn the history of places, both obviously industrial like factories, and not so obviously, like supermarkets? Is there a pattern in urban and rural places regarding where things are located, such as railroad lines, houses, refineries? How do industrial patterns differ from non-industrial patterns? The goal of this class is to develop a richer appreciation for the ways in which nature has pushed back, resisted, and collaborated with technologies in America.",,,"STS.036-Fall2004","STS.036||IMSCP-MD5-77bd6e0c232521538897001cb49169a1",,"http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/45559",,,"en-US",,,,,,,,,,"This site (c) Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003.

Students must complete all three components to receive credit. From course home page: A new form of entrepreneurship is developing. Instead of focusing just on one country, today’s innovative startups are increasingly looking globally for ideas, funding, people and markets. This is particularly true for new companies in Latin America, Western Europe and Asia. It is also true for many new companies in the United States. G-Lab has four goals: To familiarize students with the issues and challenges facing global startups. To provide students with the experience of working in a “global” startup. These companies are either based outside the US or are in the US and trying to go global at a very early stage in their development. To allow students to build networks of contacts with entrepreneurs and venture capitalists around the world. We very much hope that this will lead to career opportunities in a wide range of industries and countries.

We will consider optimization models with applications to transportation, logistics, manufacturing, computer science, E-business, project management, finance as well as several other domains. This subject will survey some of the applications of optimization as well as heuristics, and we will present algorithms and theory for linear programming, dynamic programming, integer programming, and non-linear programming. One way of summarizing a subject is a lecture by lecture description of the subject, or a description of the methodologies presented in the subject. We do list a lecture by lecture description, but first we describe several cross cutting themes.","16597 bytes||22130 bytes||19678 bytes||26926 bytes||19977 bytes||15855 bytes||13864 bytes||18040

While we will touch on real estate development in this course, we will focus here on ""stabilized"" (fully operational) income properties. (Financial analysis of real estate development will be covered in more depth in 11.432.) Our perspective will be that of so-called ""institutional"" real estate decision-making (e.g., pension funds, REITs, banks, life insurance companies), regarding large-scale commercial property. At this level it is important to integrate the perspectives of ""Wall Street"" (the mainstream securities investments and corporate finance establishment) and ""Main Street"" (local, traditional real estate business community). This requires a treatment of real estate investment rigorously integrated with, and built upon, the modern corporate finance and investments perspective as taught, for example, in the Brealey-Myers text in the Sloan introductory finance theory curriculum (15.401 & 15.402). However, a key objective of this course is to recognize the unique features of real estate that distinguish it from so-called ""mainstream"" securities investments and corporate finance.",,,"11.431J-Fall2002","11.431J||15.426J||IMSCP-MD5-05d273a4384b6c92de480ccd59530fd9",,"http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/41057",,,"en-US",,,,,,,,,,"This site (c) Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003.

Instead of focusing just on one country, today's innovative startups are increasingly looking globally for ideas, funding, people and markets. This is particularly true for new companies in Latin America, Western Europe and Asia. It is also true for many new companies in the United States. G-Lab has four goals: 1. To familiarize students with the issues and challenges facing global startups. 2. To provide students with the experience of working in a ""global"" startup. These companies are either based outside the US or are in the US and trying to go global at a very early stage in their development. 3. To allow students to build networks of contacts with entrepreneurs and venture capitalists around the world. We very much hope that this will lead to career opportunities in a wide range of industries and countries. We also hope your experience will help you decide whether, when and how you would like to work as a global entrepreneur. 4. To offer high quality advice for global startups.

The growth of e-business moves businesses from the place to the space. The familiar components of the place: cash, checks, paper reports and documents, store fronts, and face to face meetings remain important, but less so. In addition, growing in importance is the space where information in all its forms becomes digital and the cost of replicating and distributing this information approaches zero. The business models for e-business are emerging, being simultaneously developed and market tested by firms who are doing business electronically. Subject focuses on how to understand the viable e-business models for existing businesses. The challenges facing existing, traditional, and successful firms that must operate in both place and space are addressed in detail. Restricted to graduate students.

You will learn and practice the technical skills and analytic frameworks that are necessary to negotiate successfully with peers from other top business schools, and you will learn methods for developing the powerful social capital you will need to rise in the executive ranks of any organization. In this course, you will learn to successfully face the challenge of negotiating materially rewarding deals while also building your social capital. You will work with training materials on leadership and relationship building that have been used with over 200 principals and partners in international professional service firms (40% were non-US nationals), and a social capital assessment tool used by these executives to receive feedback from senior partners and over 2000 clients. In addition, you will have the opportunity to participate in a lunchtime workshop on ""Leadership and Emotional Intelligence"" led by an executive coach, Charles Wolfe of Charles J Wolfe Associates. Overall, this course is designed to enhance your ability to negotiate within the context of an ongoing relationship. As a manager, consultant, or professional service provider you will negotiate with your counterparts, team members, clients, and subordinates on an ongoing basis. Further, in today's less hierarchical organizations, you will be forced to negotiate with others to get your work done. Every time a project falls behind, critical new information is uncovered, or the competitive landscape of your industry changes, you will need to renegotiate tasks, plans, goals, or fees with your key stakeholders. In sum, we will focus both on the analytic tools necessary to become a highly successful negotiator and on the relationship building skills necessary to negotiate deals that will enhance your social capital, your ability to lead others, and your book of loyal clients.",,,"15.665B-Fall2002","15.665B||IMSCP-MD5-f550ab1048fd3d2a2f9f4612796aa34b",,"http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/97001",,,"en-US",,,,,,,,"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported","This site (c) Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2015.

The mission statement of the AITI program is based on the idea that information technology carries the potential to empower people around the globe with knowledge. The AITI program is implemented with emphasis on classroom teaching, community-oriented projects, and independent learning. MIT-AITI achieves this goal by sending MIT students to three African nations in order to teach both students and teachers through intensive classroom and lab sessions for six weeks. Hence, MIT-AITI provides MIT students with an opportunity for community service where they can apply their extensive engineering skills.

Reading and writing assignments and other exercises stress the connections between clear thinking, critical reading, and effective writing. From the course home page: Course Description This course examines the principles and practices of clear and effective communication in addressing public issues and policies. It aims to help students plan, organize, and present their analysis and research in the form of well-founded claims and persuasive arguments that address the interests, concerns, and expectations of their audience. To achieve this aim, the course encompasses the following learning objectives: to sharpen students' persuasive skills in the service of planning, program, and policy analysis; to develop students' writing style to help them achieve the clarity and vigor needed to be persuasive in their academic and professional lives; to provide practice in presenting the fruits of research orally; and to provide guidance in the use of source material, both conventional and electronic, in the conduct of research, the sharing of information with colleagues, and the production of finished work The curriculum consists of a series of writing assignments, due in alternate weeks, that focus on case studies in organizational and public communication, capped by an oral presentation on a planning topic of the student's own choosing. The planning topic would ideally be one that focuses on the individual student's research interests, either current or projected. The presentation could consist of anything from a contemplated research proposal to preliminary findings to substantially completed research with conclusions and recommendations. It should also serve as a capstone activity encompassing the learning in the course.","16742 bytes||15621 bytes||39174 bytes||19197 bytes||13132 bytes||11455 bytes||16617 bytes||11 bytes||4586 bytes||21366 bytes||11602 bytes||18220 bytes||4755 bytes||27322 bytes||25313 bytes||4039 bytes||301 bytes||354 bytes||339 bytes||180 bytes||285 bytes||67 bytes||17685 bytes||49 bytes||143 bytes||247 bytes||19283 bytes||262 bytes||42040 bytes||768058 bytes||1482562 bytes||2572443 bytes||2872509 bytes||1442334 bytes||1257078 bytes||1331725 bytes||2134936 bytes||661358 bytes||1167377 bytes||1409396 bytes||2447988 bytes||712757 bytes||466317 bytes||4544337 bytes||3808102 bytes||26574 bytes||18023 bytes||8802 bytes||19010 bytes||14824 bytes||19283 bytes||3486 bytes||811 bytes||813 bytes||830 bytes||542 bytes||2097 bytes||32076 bytes||8571 bytes||9509 bytes||9109 bytes||10498 bytes||8429 bytes||10576 bytes||9132 bytes||8584 bytes||9485 bytes||9467 bytes||9112 bytes||9519 bytes||9485 bytes||9095 bytes||8581 bytes||9543 bytes||8536 bytes||9603 bytes||8671 bytes||9602 bytes||9072 bytes||9602 bytes||8567 bytes||9558 bytes||10576 bytes||9835 bytes||9575 bytes||9517 bytes||9464 bytes","text/html||text/html||text/html||text/html||text/html||text/html||text/html||text/plain||text/html||text/html||text/html||text/html||text/html||text/css||text/css||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||image/jpeg||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||image/jpeg||image/gif||image/jpeg||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||image/jpeg||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||text/html||text/plain||application/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml","11.225-Fall2002","11.225||IMSCP-MD5-d94130513f700b5241f8e732e875da01",,"http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/34952",,,"en-US",,,,,,,,,,"This site (c) Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003.

Few incoming students have had prior exposure to these topics. The first two-thirds of the semester is given over to Microeconomics (11.203). It is designed for incoming city planning students with little or no economics background. Incoming students take a voluntary microeconomics test-out at the beginning of the semester. Those that pass the test-out are exempt from taking Microeconomics.

We begin from the perspective the brain is a wonderful information-processing instrument, but in those cases where a computer and the brain can process information in roughly the same way the computer can often do it at lower cost. This fact leads to a pair of crosscutting market forces: Information technology is opening up many new opportunities through its complementarity with some human skills. In both existing and new jobs, information technology is replacing human labor in certain tasks by substituting for other human skills. We will explore the current limits on computer's ability to substitute for human skills, discuss the human skills that computers complement,and assess the net effect of these forces on the labor market.","15987 bytes||13053 bytes||25773 bytes||38314 bytes||13361 bytes||12286 bytes||11 bytes||4586 bytes||21366 bytes||11602 bytes||38351 bytes||4755 bytes||27322 bytes||25313 bytes||4039 bytes||301 bytes||354 bytes||339 bytes||180 bytes||285 bytes||67 bytes||17685 bytes||49 bytes||143 bytes||247 bytes||19283 bytes||262 bytes||32770 bytes||51308 bytes||40958 bytes||38768 bytes||36690 bytes||43323 bytes||59034 bytes||35278 bytes||62051 bytes||43498 bytes||42237 bytes||49497 bytes||128844 bytes||20278 bytes||100877 bytes||28497 bytes||74837 bytes||19283 bytes||3486 bytes||811 bytes||813 bytes||830 bytes||572 bytes||2097 bytes||29080 bytes||8732 bytes||8071 bytes||8732 bytes||8732 bytes||8732 bytes||8732 bytes||8083 bytes||8067 bytes||8742 bytes||9969 bytes||8732 bytes||8732 bytes||8742 bytes||8732 bytes||8734 bytes||8085 bytes||8743 bytes||8734 bytes||8743 bytes||8049 bytes||8048 bytes||8742 bytes||8732 bytes","text/html||text/html||text/html||text/html||text/html||text/html||text/plain||text/html||text/html||text/html||text/html||text/html||text/css||text/css||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||image/jpeg||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||image/jpeg||image/gif||image/jpeg||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||image/jpeg||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||text/html||text/plain||application/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml","11.128-Spring2003","11.128||IMSCP-MD5-852a0868ee0b38a8c098a2c0d6e74828",,"http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/35858",,,"en-US",,,,,,,,,,"This site (c) Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003.

The goals are to help students: Acquire technical skills in the use of GIS software. Acquire qualitative methods skills in data and document gathering, analyzing information, and presenting results. Investigate the potential and practicality of GIS technologies in a typical planning setting and evaluate possible applications. The workshop teaches GIS techniques and basic database management at a level that extends somewhat beyond the basic thematic mapping and data manipulation skills included in the MCP core classes (viz.11.204 and 11.220). Instead of focusing on one thematic map of a single variable, students will concentrate on more open-ended planning questions that invite spatial analysis but will require judgment and exploration to select relevant data and mapping techniques, involve mixing and matching new, local data with extracts from official records (such as census data, parcel data and regional employment and population forecasts), utilize spatial analysis techniques such as buffering, address matching, overlays use other modeling and visualization techniques beyond thematic mapping, and raise questions about the skills, strategy, and organizational support needed to sustain such analytic capability within a variety of local and regional planning settings.

Explores various modeling software packages, criteria for developing the most appropriate simulation for a given situation, and methods for evaluating the success and utility of models. Students with an education focus consider what and how people learn from simulations, and how modeling tools can be implemented in public school settings. Graduate students are expected to complete additional assignments. From the course home page: Course Description During the past ten years, simulation modeling, especially as it helps people to understand complex systems, has become a mainstream use of computational technology. The widespread popularity of ""edutainment"" software like SimCity and Civilization gives a clear indication of the extent to which simulation games have permeated popular culture. As these and other games have found places in the classroom, researchers have tried to ascertain what and how students learn from these environments, and what implications this has for software and curriculum design. While it can be useful to experiment with pre-built models like SimCity, a deeper understanding can come through building and manipulating models whose underlying structure is accessible. Just as a young child learns more by building a bridge out of blocks instead of merely playing with a pre-fabricated bridge, designing and creating your own models provide richer learning experiences than simply playing with pre-built models. This learning process is critically important in domains that require an understanding of complex systems, from economics and mathematics to physics and biology. In this project-based course, students from all disciplines are encouraged to understand how we learn from computer environments, develop and investigate systems and ideas from their fields of study, and delve into the process of building and testing models and simulations. In the first part of the course we will explore the design and use of games and simulations in the classroom, and the research and development issues associated with this software. We will then explore various modeling and simulation software packages, criteria for developing the most appropriate simulation for a given situation, and methods for evaluating the success and utility of models. We will also study what and how people learn from simulations (including field testing of software), and how modeling and simulation tools can be implemented in educational settings.

Studies the forms and structures of argumentation, including organization of ideas, awareness of audience, methods of persuasion, evidence, factual vs emotional argument, figures of speech, and historical forms and uses of arguments. From the course home page: Course Description Introduction to 21W.747 This course is an introduction to the history, the theory, the practice, and the implications (both social and ethical) of rhetoric, the art and craft of persuasion. This semester, many of your skills will be deepened by practice, including your analytical skills, your critical thinking skills, your persuasive writing skills, and your oral presentation skills. In this course you will act as both a rhetor (a person who uses rhetoric) and a rhetorician (one who studies the art of rhetoric). Because the study of rhetoric has always had as one of its goals the creation of active and informed citizens and because rhetors write to influence the real world and thus to become agents of positive change, 21W.747 has an optional Service Learning (SL) component: You may elect to write/work for a non-profit organization that deals with some social issue. To offset the 20-30 hours during the semester that the SL option will involve, those who select it will substitute their non-profit writing for essay #4 or use their experiences there as the main source for one of their essays. Further, their experiences may be the basis for their final extemporaneous speech (thus reducing time spent on research). What is Rhetoric? Rhetoric is the art and craft of discourse; it is the study and creation of effective communication and persuasion. Studying rhetoric teaches us not only how to write persuasively but also how to understand the rhetorical efforts of others. Understanding rhetoric gives us the means of judging whose opinion about issues is the most accurate, useful, or valid, because such knowledge allows us to see beyond the persuasive techniques to the essence of the opinions. Further, understanding rhetoric is the best way of understanding the assumptions of and the points made by those who disagree with our positions. Further still, understanding rhetoric is the best way for us to deepen and refine our own positions and beliefs by exploring our own assumptions and our cultural contexts. In short, rhetoric teaches us how to find the limits of our own positions, how to argue effectively against others' positions, and how to create powerful and persuasive arguments for our own beliefs. At its best, rhetoric is used ethically by people of good will who wish to present their ideas forcibly but fairly to their communities. At its worst, however, rhetoric is used unethically by people to manipulate us instead of enlightening us, to spread propaganda instead of seeking truth, to make palatable those ideas and products whose adoption actually runs counter to our best interests. Understanding rhetoric, then, is our best defense against its abusers-- e.g., political ""spin doctors,"" advertisers, demagogues, apologists for immoral business practices, and hate mongers. Using rhetoric in an ethical manner is our best method for becoming agents for positive change in our society.","19467 bytes||27543 bytes||61402 bytes||30984 bytes||35243 bytes||13344 bytes||16399 bytes||11 bytes||4586 bytes||18637 bytes||11602 bytes||18220 bytes||4755 bytes||27322 bytes||25313 bytes||4039 bytes||301 bytes||354 bytes||339 bytes||180 bytes||285 bytes||67 bytes||17685 bytes||49 bytes||143 bytes||247 bytes||19283 bytes||262 bytes||30758 bytes||47362 bytes||43031 bytes||103182 bytes||102883 bytes||93044 bytes||87560 bytes||86362 bytes||75667 bytes||88461 bytes||98341 bytes||145146 bytes||118046 bytes||66861 bytes||19283 bytes||3486 bytes||811 bytes||813 bytes||830 bytes||507 bytes||2097 bytes||23630 bytes||9838 bytes||10395 bytes||10360 bytes||9810 bytes||10385 bytes||9873 bytes||9691 bytes||10372 bytes||10330 bytes||10393 bytes||10331 bytes||10369 bytes||10330 bytes||9933 bytes||10368 bytes||9816 bytes||11062 bytes||10357 bytes||10330 bytes||9845 bytes||10402 bytes","text/html||text/html||text/html||text/html||text/html||text/html||text/html||text/plain||text/html||text/html||text/html||text/html||text/html||text/css||text/css||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||image/jpeg||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||image/jpeg||image/gif||image/jpeg||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||application/pdf||image/jpeg||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||image/gif||text/html||text/plain||application/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml||text/xml","21W.747-Fall2002","21W.747||IMSCP-MD5-75275af8974c9fddc7e3069f59b58e4b",,"http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/34882",,,"en-US",,,,,,,,,,"This site (c) Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003.

John Muir, founder of the Sierra Club, evoked the wonders of California's Hetch Hetchy Valley in the hope that he could stop a dam with words. Another early environmentalist, Aldo Leopold, summoned up a world made barren by the loss of predators in the hope that he could stop the slaughter of wolves. More recently, Rachel Carson, a marine biologist with a penchant for writing, described a world without wildlife in Silent Spring and altered the way that Americans understood their impact on the landscape. Leopold and Carson were professional scientists, and like the other writers we will encounter this fall, they realized that they could alter the perceptions of their contemporaries only if they were able to transmit their knowledge in engaging and accessible language. We will do our best to follow in their footsteps. We will consider the strategies of popular science writers like Lewis Thomas, David Quammen, John McPhee, and Ursula K. LeGuin. We will also sample works by less familiar geologists,hydrologists, and biologists. Students in this course will have a chance to try out several ways of characterizing and explaining natural environments.

Now, the turn not just of a century but of a millennium having recently passed, such scrutiny and speculations inevitably intensify. What will the future that awaits us in this twenty-first century and beyond be like? And how do visions of that future reflect and respond to the world we live in now? In this writing course we will read and write about how some twentieth-century writers and filmmakers have attended to the present as a way of imagining-and warning about-possible worlds to come. Guided by our reading and discussion, we will scrutinize our own present and construct our own visions of the future through close readings of the texts as well as of some aspects of contemporary culture-urban and environmental crises, economic imperialism, sexual and reproductive politics, issues of race and gender, the romance of technology, robotics and cyborg cultures, media saturation, language and representation-and the persistent questions they pose about what it means to be human at this threshold of a new millennium.",,,"21W.730-1-Spring2004","21W.730-1||IMSCP-MD5-2f69b8e1a0edca0250fb6aecbfb391af",,"http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/45573",,,"en-US",,,,,,,,,,"This site (c) Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003.

Food is at once the stuff of life and a potent symbol; it binds us to the earth, to our families, and to our cultures. The aroma of turkey roasting or the taste of green tea can be a portal to memories, while too many Big Macs can clog our arteries. The chef is an artist, yet those who pick oranges or process meat may be little more than slaves. In this class, we will explore many of the fascinating issues that surround food as both material fact and personal and cultural symbol. We will read essays by Chang-Rae Lee, Francine du Plessix Gray, M. F. K. Fisher, Anthony Bourdain, and others on such topics as family meals, the art and science of cooking, fair trade, eating disorders, and food's ability to awaken us to ""our own powers of enjoyment"" (M. F. K. Fisher). We will also read Eric Schlosser's Fast Food Nation and view one or more films or videos as a class. Assigned essays will grow out of memories and the texts we read, and will include personal narratives and essays that depend on research.

Even technology once considered distinctly ""modern"" - photography, the telephone, movies, television - has been altered or replaced by faster and more dynamic media that allow more manipulation and control by the individual. Anyone can now create stunning photographic images without a processing lab; and film no longer earns its name, as the cinema often presents images that were never filmed to begin with, but created or doctored in the digital domain. What are the consequences of these changes for the media and arts they alter? How does digitizing affect the values, ethical and aesthetic, of images, texts, and sounds? How do these technologies change the way we spend our time and relate to other people? In the age of the digital, what becomes of property, of history, of identity? Through a series of careful comparisons of images, texts, movies, games, and music - pre-digital versus post-digital - this course will analyze the ways in which these media and our responses to them have changed in the digital era; and we will ask about the value of these changes.",,,"21W.784-Fall2005","21W.784||IMSCP-MD5-d071820232c3555d61e10dda21c16b7a",,"http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/69821",,,"en-US",,,,,,,,,,"This site (c) Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2012.
