Lecture 7: Problem Set 7 (Due Apr. 11) 
Reading: Emotion Machine, Chapter 6 
Problem 1 
In order to find meaningful answers you must first be able to formulate 
good questions. List ten questions you would like to answer about 
Chapter 6. 
Problem 2 
You could think of scripts as compiled plans. 
a) Write a script for going to a restaurant as a sequence of actions. 
For an example of a script, see pg. 192−3. 
b) List the transframes in each applicable mental realm (the Panalogy 
representation) for each step of the script. 
c) Imagine now that you are trying to plan for cooking some food at home. 
Do the same thing you did in parts (a,b) for this second plan. 
d) Now list the similarities and differences between the panalogies in 
your two scripts. This will form a matrix−like structure. 
Note that the process of adapting the second plan from the first 
script, by analogy, could be described as actions within a 
reflective−level script! 
Problem 3 
Imagine a situation in which you are hungry. 
a) List what this knowledge would look like (e.g., your goals, 
your environment). Consider this knowledge to be reactive. 
b) Describe two deliberative level critics that can select between 
these two eating−plans from Problem 2 using some of the knowledge 
in the reactive level.
