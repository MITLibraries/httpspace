Course Overview
The subject of this course is to discuss theories about how our minds work. We will emphasize aspects of thinking that are so poorly understood that they are still considered to be more philosophical than scientific. These issues have never been understood because of our traditional image of the mind as controlled by a single, central Self. The folly of this becomes obvious when you think about how to build systems to do things that might help answer questions like these:
How do children learn about morality and social goals?
How does one learn a new way to think to handle a new type of situation?
How do minds switch between different representations and methods of reasoning?
Why do we like jokes?
Why do we like music?
What are ideas?
What is pain and why does it hurt?
What is consciousness?
What use are emotions?
What is the nature of Self?
What controls the subjects you think about?
Our goal is to replace ill-defined folk theories of 'consciousness', 'self' and 'emotion' with other concepts that are more useful for engineers to build, psychologists to manipulate, and individuals to control.
Caveat Emptor
This course is for students who have already read The Society of Mind. Without that background, it will be hard to learn from the lectures. This subject is still highly speculative, and many students find that it lacks the precision found in more mature areas. Furthermore, people have different learning styles, and you may find my teaching style to be too experimental and improvisatory for you. Do not hesitate to drop the subject early if you find such an incompatibility. In any case, to help make the class seminar interactive, you should always come prepared with some issue to discuss.
