Course Highlights
Marvin Minsky has made significant contributions to the field of Artificial Intelligence, and this course, along with his book of the same title, illuminates new ideas on thinking and how the mind works.
Course Description
This course is an introduction to a theory that tries to explain how minds are made from collections of simpler processes. The subject treats such aspects of thinking as vision, language, learning, reasoning, memory, consciousness, ideals, emotions, and personality. Ideas incorporate psychology, artificial intelligence, and computer science to resolve theoretical issues such as whole vs. parts, structural vs. functional descriptions, declarative vs. procedural representations, symbolic vs. connectionist models, and logical vs. common-sense theories of learning.
