# README.md

The test directory is a downloaded archive of an OCW course, used here for
testing purposes. The test suite will copy it to a temp directory in order to
test file manipulation while keeping the original data clean for future testing.
Some content has been changed in order to ensure that edge cases of the test suite are exercised.
